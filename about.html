                Welcome to my personal website! My name is Alexis Barraza, and this site serves as a platform to showcase the work I’ve done in software development.
                The journey that led me here is one of discovering my true passion. I initially pursued a career as a surgical tech, but I quickly realized it wasn’t the path for me.
                Everything changed when I enrolled in a Computer Modeling class, where I found my love for coding. Since then, I’ve been fully immersed in learning and mastering the skills
                needed to become a proficient software developer. Currently, I’m in my final semester of a Computer Programming program, with graduation on the horizon in December. This site
                not only serves as a digital portfolio of my work but also as a testament to the dedication and passion I have for the field of software development. Throughout this site,
                you’ll find examples of projects I’ve completed, ranging from web development to data-driven applications. Each project highlights a different aspect of my skill set and demonstrates
                my ability to solve complex problems through code. Whether you’re a potential employer, a fellow developer, or just someone interested in the work I do, I hope you find this site
                informative and engaging. Feel free to explore the different sections, learn more about my background and projects,
                and don’t hesitate to reach out via the contact page if you have any questions or opportunities to discuss. Thank you for visiting!
